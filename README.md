> I'm loving it!  

#### (This project is developed on Visual Studio 2019)

## I am a super fan of McDonald. That's why I took the opportunity of my computer graphics assignment to design and build a 3D model of McDonald drive-thrurestaurant. Hope you like it and any comments are welcomed!

### Introduction:
>The three-dimensional model is designed to imitate a genuine McDonald's drive-thru restaurant scenario, which includes a two-story McDonald's restaurant, a road sign to the left of the restaurant, and two moving cars in front of it, as well as the ground and background. The drive-thru restaurant and the signboard, which is based on a real-life McDonald's restaurant, are the key elements of this scenario. In addition, realistic ground and backdrop textures are used to create a more immersive daily life atmosphere. Aside from static models, the animation of the car driving and the opening and closing of the restaurant's front door replicates a more vivid scene of stepping out of the car and entering the restaurant. Likewise, the program provides a certain level of interactive functionality, preliminary accomplishing a specific range of human-like perspective adjustments, allowing the user's view to be remoted by keyboard input. In this manner, the scene can be viewed from several angles.
